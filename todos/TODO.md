# TODO - Cheatsheet Generator Improvements

## 🚀 High Priority - Core Functionality
[x] send basic prompt
[x] test api connection first
[ ] send first request for bash cheatsheet

[ ] Add distributed tracing for API calls
[ ] Create dashboards for system health
[ ] Add alerting for critical failures
[ ] Implement audit logging for compliance

## 🚀 Performance & Scalability
[ ] Implement caching layer for API responses
[ ] Add async/await for I/O operations
[ ] Implement connection pooling for API clients
[ ] Add rate limiting and throttling
[ ] Optimize memory usage for large responses
[ ] Add horizontal scaling capabilities

## 🔒 Security & Compliance
[ ] Implement secure API key management
[ ] Add input sanitization and validation
[ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
